#Btapp Api Visualizer
This is a real time data viewer built on top of the [btapp.js](http://github.com/bittorrenttorque/btapp) library. While it's an example of a rather simple app built using the library, it is mostly useful as a development tool. If you're curious what functions/state is available, this is the easiest way to poke around.
